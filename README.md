Here I added a double space.

*This will appear as italicized*

**This will appear as bold**

# This is a main header
## This is a secondary header
### This is a tertiary header

This is how we list items:
- one
- two
- three

And this is how we order items:

1.  one
2.  two
3.  three

Here I show how to [link to Github](https://github.com/)

Creating a table:

col A | col B
-------|--------
1 | 2
3 | 4

To embed an image:
